# Mapbox-Android-Test

This demo uses Mapbox, which requires a API access token to develop with.  You can obtain one from https://www.mapbox.com/.  In order to build this project, you will need to add that API token to your `local.properties` file.  Add the following line:

`mapbox.api.key="your-access-token-here"`

and replace the string text with your access token.
